ST7920 Graphic Display Driver for Arduino IDE (Standard 128x64 ST7920 Displays Only)
Version 1.2

This driver was designed to run on 32-bit CPUs (Teensy, Arduino DUE, ESP32, etc...)
It should also run on 8-bit AVR CPUs, but it might lack performance.

This is a little driver to control the ST7920 display, meant for working with Arduino IDE.
It's still very basic, there are a lot of improvements to be done and functionalities to be added, but it just works.
